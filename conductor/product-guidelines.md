# Product Guidelines

## Documentation Style
- **Technical and Precise:** Documentation should be clear, accurate, and focused on providing developers with the exact information they need to use the tools effectively.
- **Metric-Driven:** When discussing performance, use specific benchmarks and data points where possible.
- **Example-Heavy:** Provide practical code snippets and command-line examples for all features.

## Brand Messaging
- **Speed first:** Always highlight the performance advantages of using a Rust-based toolkit.
- **Empowerment:** Focus on how Foundry gives developers more control and deeper insights into their smart contracts.
- **Reliability:** Emphasize the robustness and stability of the tools, especially for production environments.

## Development Principles
- **Modularity:** New features should be designed as modular components that can integrate with the existing suite.
- **Performance-Oriented:** Any new addition should be evaluated for its impact on compilation and execution speed.
- **Security-Conscious:** Maintain a high standard for security, especially in components that handle keys or interact with live networks.
