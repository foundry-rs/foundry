# Initial Concept

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

# Product Guide

## Target Audience
- **Smart Contract Developers:** The primary users who need a robust, fast, and comprehensive toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts.

## Core Goals
- **Performance:** To provide the fastest possible development experience, minimizing wait times for compilation and testing cycles.
- **Portability:** To ensure the toolkit works seamlessly across different operating systems and environments with minimal setup.
- **Modularity:** To offer a suite of specialized tools (like Forge, Cast, Anvil, and Chisel) that work together but can also be used independently to solve specific development tasks.
- **Developer Experience:** To offer a modern, intuitive, and Rust-based alternative to existing JavaScript/TypeScript-based development frameworks.

## Key Features
- **Forge:** A fast and flexible build and test tool.
- **Cast:** A swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data.
- **Anvil:** A local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache or Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel:** A fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.
