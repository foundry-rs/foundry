# Linter (`lint`)

Solidity linter for identifying potential errors, vulnerabilities, gas optimizations, and style guide violations.
It helps enforce best practices and improve code quality within Foundry projects.

## Architecture

The `forge-lint` system operates by analyzing Solidity source code:

1.  **Parsing**: Solidity source files are parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using `solar-parse`. This AST represents the structure of the code.
2.  **AST Traversal**: The generated AST is then traversed using a Visitor pattern. The `EarlyLintVisitor` is responsible for walking through the AST nodes.
3.  **Applying Lint Passes**: As the visitor encounters different AST nodes (like functions, expressions, variable definitions), it invokes registered "lint passes" (`EarlyLintPass` implementations). Each pass is designed to check for a specific code pattern.
4.  **Emitting Diagnostics**: If a lint pass identifies a violation of its rule, it uses the `LintContext` to emit a diagnostic (either `warning` or `note`) that pinpoints the issue in the source code.

### Key Components

*   **`Linter` Trait**: Defines a generic interface for linters. `SolidityLinter` is the concrete implementation tailored for Solidity.
*   **`Lint` Trait & `SolLint` Struct**:
    *   `Lint`: A trait that defines the essential properties of a lint rule, such as its unique ID, severity, description, and an optional help message/URL.
    *   `SolLint`: A struct implementing the `Lint` trait, used to hold the metadata for each specific Solidity lint rule.
*   **`EarlyLintPass<'ast>` Trait**: Lints that operate directly on AST nodes implement this trait. It contains methods (like `check_expr`, `check_item_function`, etc.) called by the visitor.
*   **`LintContext<'s>`**: Provides contextual information to lint passes during execution, such as access to the session for emitting diagnostics.
*   **`EarlyLintVisitor<'a, 's, 'ast>`**: The core visitor that traverses the AST and dispatches checks to the registered `EarlyLintPass` instances.

## Developing a new lint rule

1. Specify an issue that is being addressed in the PR description.
2. In your PR:
  *   Create a static `SolLint` instance using the `declare_forge_lint!` to define its metadata.
      ```rust
      declare_forge_lint!(
          MIXED_CASE_FUNCTION,                      // The Rust identifier for this SolLint static
          Severity::Info,                           // The default severity of the lint
          "mixed-case-function",                    // A unique string ID for configuration/CLI
          "function names should use mixedCase",    // A brief description
          "https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#function-names" // Optional help link
      );
      ```

  *   Register the pass struct and the lint using `register_lints!` in the `mod.rs` of its corresponding severity category. This macro generates the necessary boilerplate to make them discoverable by the linter, and creates helper functions to instantiate them.
      ```rust
      register_lints!(
          (PascalCaseStruct, (PASCAL_CASE_STRUCT)),
          (MixedCaseVariable, (MIXED_CASE_VARIABLE)),
          (MixedCaseFunction, (MIXED_CASE_FUNCTION))
      );
      // The structs `PascalCaseStruct`, `MixedCaseVariable`, etc., would have to manually implement `EarlyLintPass`.
      ```

  *   Implement the `EarlyLintPass` trait logic for the pass struct. Do it in a new file within the relevant severity module (e.g., `src/sol/med/my_new_lint.rs`).

3. Add comprehensive tests in `lint/testdata/`:
    *   Create `MyNewLint.sol` with various examples (triggering and non-triggering cases, edge cases).
    *   Generate the corresponding blessed file with the expected output.

### Testing a lint rule

Tests are located in the `lint/testdata/` directory. A test for a lint rule involves:

 - A Solidity source file with various code snippets, some of which are expected to trigger the lint. Expected diagnostics must be indicated with either `//~WARN: description` or `//~NOTE: description` on the relevant line.
 - corresponding `.stderr` (blessed) file which contains the exact diagnostic output the linter is expected to produce for that source file.

The testing framework runs the linter on the `.sol` file and compares its standard error output against the content of the `.stderr` file to ensure correctness.

- Run the following command to trigger the ui test runner:
  ```sh
  // using the default cargo cmd for running tests
  cargo test -p forge --test ui

  // using nextest
  cargo nextest run -p forge test ui
  ```

- If you need to generate / bless (re-generate) the output files:
  ```sh
  // using the default cargo cmd for running tests
  cargo test -p forge --test ui -- --bless
  ```
