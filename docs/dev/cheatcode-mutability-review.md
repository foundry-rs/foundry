# Cheatcode Mutability Review Checklist

This document tracks all cheatcodes currently marked `external` with no `view` or `pure` mutability modifier.

Total reviewed: **231**

---

## Summary

| Mutability | Count | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| `pure`     | 1     | Stateless helper functions |
| `view`     | 11    | Reads test environment state |
| `-` (keep as is) | 219 | Modifies test state or relies on test state |

---

## Review Criteria

From issue [#10027](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/10027):

- If a cheatcode **modifies observable state** for later cheatcode calls (EVM, interpreter, filesystem), it is neither `view` nor `pure`
- If a cheatcode **reads** from prior cheatcode state or environment state, it is `view`
- If a cheatcode **has no side effects** and doesnâ€™t depend on test stat, it is `pure`

## Mutability Suggestions

### Pure Cheatcodes

Mark `pure`:

- [x] `contains`: `contains(string,string)` _suggested: `pure`_

---

### View Cheatcodes

Mark `view`:

- [x] `accessList`: `accessList(address,bytes32[])` _resolved: not view, keep as is due to test coverage indicating stateful behavior_
- [ ] `accesses`: `accesses(address)`
- [ ] `eth_getLogs`: `eth_getLogs(uint256,uint256,address,bytes32[])`
- [ ] `getMappingKeyAndParentOf`: `getMappingKeyAndParentOf(address,bytes32)`
