# Custom Network Features

Foundry's `anvil`, `forge` and `cast` tools can be customized with specific network features (currently with custom 
precompiles, with planned support for custom transaction types).

For supporting custom features of a network, please check out documentation and examples within [`evm-networks`](../../crates/evm/networks) crate.
