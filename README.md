**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](./forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and Dapptools).
- [**Cast**](./cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain
  data.

## Installation 

First run the command below to get `foundryup`, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then in a new terminal session or after reloading your PATH, run it to get the latest `forge` and `cast` binaries:

```
foundryup
```

Advanced ways to use `foundryup` and other documentation can be found in the [foundryup package](./foundryup/README.md). Happy forging!

## Forge

More documentation can be found in the [forge package](./forge/README.md) and in the [CLI README](./cli/README.md).

### Features

1. Fast & flexible compilation pipeline:
    1. Automatic Solidity compiler version detection & installation (under
       `~/.svm`)
    1. Incremental compilation & caching: Only changed files are re-compiled
    1. Parallel compilation
    1. Non-standard directory structures support (e.g. can build
       [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829))
1. Tests are written in Solidity (like in DappTools)
1. Fast fuzz Tests with shrinking of inputs & printing of counter-examples
1. Fast remote RPC forking mode leveraging Rust's async infrastructure like tokio
1. Flexible debug logging:
    1. Dapptools-style, using `DsTest`'s emitted logs
    1. Hardhat-style, using the popular `console.sol` contract
1. Portable (5-10MB) & easy to install statically linked binary without requiring Nix or any other package manager
1. Abstracted over EVM implementations (currently supported: Sputnik, EvmOdin)

### How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging the
[ethers-solc](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/tree/master/ethers-solc/)
package) and testing.

Some benchmarks below:

| Project                                             | Forge | DappTools | Speedup |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| [guni-lev](https://github.com/hexonaut/guni-lev/)   | 28.6s | 2m36s     | 5.45x   |
| [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/) | 6s    | 46s       | 7.66x   |
| [geb](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb)         | 11s   | 40s       | 3.63x   |
| [vaults](https://github.com/rari-capital/vaults)    | 1.4s  | 5.5s      | 3.9x    |

It also works with "non-standard" directory structures (i.e. contracts not in
`src/`, libraries not in `lib/`). When
[tested](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829) with
[`openzeppelin-contracts`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts), Hardhat compilation took 15.244s,
whereas Forge took 9.449 (~4s cached)

## Cast

Cast is a swiss army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

More documentation can be found in the [cast package](./cast/README.md).

## Setup

### VSCode

[juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity) describes in detail how to configure
the `vscode` extension.

If you're using dependency libraries, then you'll need [_
Remappings_](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity#remappings) so the extension can find the imports.

The easiest way to add remappings is creating a `remappings.txt` file in the root folder, which can be generated with
auto inferred remappings:

```shell
forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

See also [./cli/README.md](./cli/README.md#Remappings).

Alternatively you can use the extension's dir structure settings to configure your contracts and dependency directory.
If your contracts are stored in `./src` and libraries in `./lib`, you can add

```json
"solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesContractsDirectory": "src",
"solidity.packageDefaultDependenciesDirectory": "lib"
```

to your `.vscode` file

It's also recommended to specify a solc compiler version for the
extension, [read more](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity#remote-download):

```json
"solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion": "v0.8.10"
```

## Autocompletion

You can generate autocompletion shell scripts for bash, elvish, fish, powershell, and zsh.

Example (zsh / [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/))

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions
forge completions zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_forge
cast completions zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_cast
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Contributing

### Directory structure

This repository contains several Rust crates:

- [`forge`](forge): Library for building and testing a Solidity repository.
- [`cast`](cast): Library for interacting with a live Ethereum JSON-RPC compatible node, or for parsing data.
- [`cli`](cli): Command line interfaces to `cast` and `forge`.
- [`evm-adapters`](evm-adapters): Unified layer of abstraction over multiple EVM types. Currently supported EVMs:
  [Sputnik](https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/),
  [Evmodin](https://github.com/vorot93/evmodin).
- [`utils`](utils): Utilities for parsing ABI data, will eventually be upstreamed
  to [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/).

### Rust Toolchain

We use the stable Rust toolchain. Install by running:
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`.

#### Minimum Supported Rust Version

The current minimum supported Rust version is
`rustc 1.54.0 (a178d0322 2021-07-26)`.

### Testing

```shell
cargo check
cargo test
cargo doc --open
```

### Formatting

We use the nightly toolchain for formatting and linting.

```
cargo +nightly fmt
cargo +nightly clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
```
