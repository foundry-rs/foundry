**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   [**Forge**](./crates/forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   [**Cast**](./crates/cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   [**Anvil**](./crates/anvil): Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   [**Chisel**](./crates/chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [ðŸ“– Foundry Book][foundry-book] (WIP)!**

## Installation

See the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the book.

If you're experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq).

## Forge

### Features

-   **Fast & flexible compilation pipeline**
    -   Automatic Solidity compiler version detection & installation
    -   **Incremental compilation & caching**: Only changed files are re-compiled
    -   Parallel compilation
    -   Non-standard directory structures support (e.g. [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829))
-   **Tests are written in Solidity** (like in DappTools)
-   **Fast fuzz testing** with shrinking of inputs & printing of counter-examples
-   **Fast remote RPC forking mode**, leveraging Rust's async infrastructure like tokio
-   **Flexible debug logging**
    -   DappTools-style, using `DsTest`'s emitted logs
    -   Hardhat-style, using the popular `console.sol` contract
-   **Portable (5-10MB) & easy to install** without requiring Nix or any other package manager
-   **Fast CI** with the [Foundry GitHub action][foundry-gha].

### How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging [ethers-solc]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. More benchmarks can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

**Testing Benchmarks**

| Project                            | Forge | DappTools | Speedup |
| ---------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate] | 2.8s  | 6m34s     | 140x    |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]           | 0.4s  | 23s       | 57.5x   |
| [Rari-Capital/vaults][vaults]      | 0.28s | 6.5s      | 23x     |

_Note: In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Compilation Benchmarks**

<img alt="Compilation benchmarks" src=".github/compilation-benchmark.png" width="693px" />

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster by a factor of 1.7-11.3x, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Cast

Cast is a swiss army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

More documentation can be found in the [cast package](./crates/cast).

## Configuration

### Using `foundry.toml`

Foundry is designed to be very configurable. You can configure Foundry using a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) in the root of your project, or any other parent directory. See [config package](./crates/config/README.md#all-options) for all available options.

Configuration can be arbitrarily namespaced by profiles. The default profile is named `default` (see ["Default Profile"](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile)).

You can select another profile using the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable. You can also override parts of your configuration using `FOUNDRY_` or `DAPP_` prefixed environment variables, like `FOUNDRY_SRC`.

`forge init` creates a basic, extendable `foundry.toml` file.

To see your current configuration, run `forge config`. To see only basic options (as set with `forge init`), run `forge config --basic`. This can be used to create a new `foundry.toml` file with `forge config --basic > foundry.toml`.

By default `forge config` shows the currently selected foundry profile and its values. It also accepts the same arguments as `forge build`.

### DappTools Compatibility

You can reuse your `.dapprc` environment variables by running `source .dapprc` before using a Foundry tool.

### Additional Configuration

You can find additional setup and configurations guides in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book]:

-   [Setting up VSCode][vscode-setup]
-   [Shell autocompletions][shell-setup]

## Getting Help

First, see if the answer to your question can be found in [book][foundry-book], or in the relevant crate.

If the answer is not there:

-   Join the [support Telegram][tg-support-url] to get help, or
-   Open a [discussion](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/discussions/new) with your question, or
-   Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/new)

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/foundry_rs) to chat with us about the development of Foundry!
