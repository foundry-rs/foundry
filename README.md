**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum
application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](./forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and
  Dapptools).
- [**Cast**](./cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts,
  sending transactions and getting chain data.

## Forge Quickstart

Forge is a development and testing framework for Ethereum applications.

```
cargo install forge
forge init
forge build
forge test
```

More documentation can be found in the [forge package](./forge/README.md).

### Features

1. Fast & flexible compilation pipeline:
   1. Automatic Solidity compiler version detection & installation (under
      `~/.svm`)
   1. Incremental compilation & caching: Only changed files are re-compiled
   1. Parallel compilation
   1. Non-standard directory structures support (e.g. can build
      [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829))
1. Tests are written in Solidity (like in DappTools)
1. Fast fuzz Tests with shrinking of inputs & printing of counter-examples
1. Fast remote RPC forking mode leveraging Rust's async infrastructure like
   tokio
1. Flexible debug logging:
   1. Dapptools-style, using `DsTest`'s emitted logs
   1. Hardhat-style, using the popular `console.sol` contract
1. Portable (5-10MB) & easy to install statically linked binary without
   requiring Nix or any other package manager
1. Abstracted over EVM implementations (currently supported: Sputnik, EvmOdin)

### How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging the
[ethers-solc](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/tree/master/ethers-solc/)
package) and testing.

Some benchmarks below:

| Project                                             | Forge | DappTools | Speedup |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| [guni-lev](https://github.com/hexonaut/guni-lev/)   | 28.6s | 2m36s     | 5.45x   |
| [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/) | 6s    | 46s       | 7.66x   |
| [geb](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb)         | 11s   | 40s       | 3.63x   |
| [vaults](https://github.com/rari-capital/vaults)    | 1.4s  | 5.5s      | 3.9x    |

It also works with "non-standard" directory structures (i.e. contracts not in
`src/`, libraries not in `lib/`). When
[tested](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829) with
[`openzeppelin-contracts`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts),
Hardhat compilation took 15.244s, whereas Forge took 9.449 (~4s cached)

## Cast Quickstart

Cast is a swiss army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the
command line.

```
cargo install cast
cast call 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 "totalSupply()" --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL
```

More documentation can be found in the [cast package](./cast/README.md).

## Contributing

### Directory structure

This repository contains several Rust crates:

- [`forge`](forge): Library for building and testing a Solidity repository.
- [`cast`](cast): Library for interacting with a live Ethereum JSON-RPC
  compatible node, or for parsing data.
- [`cli`](cli): Command line interfaces to `cast` and `forge`.
- [`evm-adapters`](evm-adapters): Unified layer of abstraction over multiple EVM
  types. Currently supported EVMs:
  [Sputnik](https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/),
  [Evmodin](https://github.com/vorot93/evmodin).
- [`utils`](utils): Utilities for parsing ABI data, will eventually be
  upstreamed to [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/).

The minimum supported rust version is 1.51.

### Rust Toolchain

We use the stable Rust toolchain. Install by running:
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`.

#### Minimum Supported Rust Version

The current minimum supported Rust version is
`rustc 1.54.0 (a178d0322 2021-07-26)`.

### Testing

```
cargo check
cargo test
cargo doc --open
```

### Formatting

```
cargo +nightly fmt
cargo clippy
```

## Acknowledgements

- Foundry is a clean-room rewrite of the testing framework
  [dapptools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools). None of this would have
  been possible without the DappHub team's work over the years.
- [Matthias Seitz](https://twitter.com/mattsse_): Created
  [ethers-solc](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/tree/master/ethers-solc/)
  which is the backbone of our compilation pipeline, as well as countless
  contributions to ethers, in particular the `abigen` macros.
- [Rohit Narunkar](https://twitter.com/rohitnarurkar): Created the Rust Solidity
  version manager [svm-rs](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs) which we use
  to auto-detect and manage multiple Solidity versions.
