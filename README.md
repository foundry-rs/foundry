**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum
application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](./forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and
  Dapptools).
- [**Cast**](./cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts,
  sending transactions and getting chain data.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [ðŸ“– Foundry
Book][foundry-book] (WIP)!**

## Installation

First run the command below to get `foundryup`, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

If you do not want to use the redirect, feel free to manually download the
foundryup installation script from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gakonst/foundry/master/foundryup/install).

Then, in a new terminal session or after reloading your `PATH`, run it to get
the latest `forge` and `cast` binaries:

```sh
foundryup
```

Advanced ways to use `foundryup`, and other documentation, can be found in the
[foundryup package](./foundryup/README.md). Happy forging!

### Installing from source

For people that want to install from source, you can do so like below:

```
git clone https://github.com/gakonst/foundry
cd foundry
cargo build --release
# copy the binaries under `./target/release/{forge, cast}` to your $PATH.
```

Or via `cargo install --git https://github.com/gakonst/foundry --locked`

### Releases

You can manually download nightly releases
[here](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/releases).

## Forge

More documentation can be found in the [forge package](./forge/README.md) and in
the [CLI README](./cli/README.md).

### Features

- **Fast & flexible compilation pipeline**
  - Automatic Solidity compiler version detection & installation (under
    `~/.svm`)
  - **Incremental compilation & caching**: Only changed files are re-compiled
  - Parallel compilation
  - Non-standard directory structures support (e.g.
    [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829))
- **Tests are written in Solidity** (like in DappTools)
- **Fast fuzz testing** with shrinking of inputs & printing of counter-examples
- **Fast remote RPC forking mode**, leveraging Rust's async infrastructure like
  tokio
- **Flexible debug logging**
  - Dapptools-style, using `DsTest`'s emitted logs
  - Hardhat-style, using the popular `console.sol` contract
- **Portable (5-10MB) & easy to install** without requiring Nix or any other
  package manager
- **Fast CI** with the [Foundry GitHub action][foundry-gha].

### How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging the
[ethers-solc](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/tree/master/ethers-solc/)
package) and testing.

Some benchmarks below:

| Project                                             | Forge | DappTools | Speedup |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| [guni-lev](https://github.com/hexonaut/guni-lev/)   | 28.6s | 2m36s     | 5.45x   |
| [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/) | 6s    | 46s       | 7.66x   |
| [geb](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb)         | 11s   | 40s       | 3.63x   |
| [vaults](https://github.com/rari-capital/vaults)    | 1.4s  | 5.5s      | 3.9x    |

It also works with "non-standard" directory structures (i.e. contracts not in
`src/`, libraries not in `lib/`). When
[tested](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829) with
[`openzeppelin-contracts`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts),
Hardhat compilation took 15.244s, whereas Forge took 9.449 (~4s cached)

## Cast

Cast is a swiss army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the
command line.

More documentation can be found in the [cast package](./cast/README.md).

## Setup

### Configuring Foundry

Foundry is designed to be very configurable. You can create a TOML file called
[`foundry.toml`](./config/README.md) place it in the project or any other parent
directory, and it will apply the options in that file. See
[config package](./config/README.md#all-options) for all available options.

Configurations can be arbitrarily namespaced by profiles. Foundry's default
configuration is also named `default`. The selected profile is the value of the
`FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable, or if it is not set, "default".
`FOUNDRY_` or `DAPP_` prefixed environment variables, like `FOUNDRY_SRC` take
precedence, [see "Default Profile"](./config/README.md#default-profile)

`forge init` creates a basic, extendable `foundry.toml` file.

To set all `.dapprc` env vars run `source .dapprc` beforehand.

To see all currently set options run `forge config`, to only see the basic
options (as set with `forge init`) run `forge config --basic`, this can be used
to create a new `foundry.toml` file with `forge config --basic > foundry.toml`.
By default `forge config` shows the currently selected foundry profile and its
values. It also accepts the same arguments as `forge build`.

### Additional Setup

You can find additional setup guides in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book]:

- [Setting up VSCode][vscode-setup]
- [Shell autocompletions][shell-setup]

### Troubleshooting Installation

#### `libusb` error when running `forge`/`cast`

If you are using the binaries as released, you may see the following error on
MacOS:

```
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/libusb/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib
```

In order to fix this, you must install `libusb` like so:

```sh
brew install libusb
```

#### Out of date `GLIBC` error when running `forge` from default `foundryup` install:

If you run into an error resembling the following when using `foundryup`:

```
forge: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by forge)
```

There are 2 workarounds:

1. Build from source using the following command:

```
foundryup -b master
```

2. For a solution using Docker, refer to this article:
   https://kobzol.github.io/rust/ci/2021/05/07/building-rust-binaries-in-ci-that-work-with-older-glibc.html#solution
