**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum
application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](./forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and
  Dapptools).
- [**Cast**](./cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts,
  sending transactions and getting chain data.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [ðŸ“– Foundry Book][foundry-book] (WIP)!**

## Installation

*Having issues? See the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-installation)*.

First run the command below to get `foundryup`, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

If you do not want to use the redirect, feel free to manually download the
foundryup installation script from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundry-rs/foundry/master/foundryup/foundryup).

Then, run `foundryup` in a new terminal session or after reloading your `PATH`.

Other ways to use `foundryup`, and other documentation, can be found [here](./foundryup). Happy forging!

### Installing from source

For people that want to install from source, you can do so like below:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry
cd foundry
cargo install --path ./cli --bins --locked --force
```

Or via `cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --locked`

### Installing via Docker

Foundry maintains a [Docker image repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pkgs/container/foundry).

You can pull the latest release image like so:  
```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest
```
For examples and guides on using this image, see the [Docker section](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/foundry-docker.html) in the book.

### Manual download

You can manually download nightly releases [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases).

## Forge

### Features

- **Fast & flexible compilation pipeline**
  - Automatic Solidity compiler version detection & installation (under
    `~/.svm`)
  - **Incremental compilation & caching**: Only changed files are re-compiled
  - Parallel compilation
  - Non-standard directory structures support (e.g.
    [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829))
- **Tests are written in Solidity** (like in DappTools)
- **Fast fuzz testing** with shrinking of inputs & printing of counter-examples
- **Fast remote RPC forking mode**, leveraging Rust's async infrastructure like
  tokio
- **Flexible debug logging**
  - Dapptools-style, using `DsTest`'s emitted logs
  - Hardhat-style, using the popular `console.sol` contract
- **Portable (5-10MB) & easy to install** without requiring Nix or any other
  package manager
- **Fast CI** with the [Foundry GitHub action][foundry-gha].

### How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging [ethers-solc][ethers-solc]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. More benchmarks can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

**Testing Benchmarks**

| Project                         | Forge | DappTools | Speedup |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| [maple-labs/loan][loan]         | 800ms | 4m28s     | 335x    |
| [Rari-Capital/solmate][solmate] | 2.8s  | 6m34s     | 140x    |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]        | 0.4s  | 23s       | 57.5x   |
| [Rari-Capital/vaults][vaults]   | 0.28s | 6.5s      | 23x     |

*Note: In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped*

**Compilation Benchmarks**

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster by a factor of 1.7-11.3x, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Cast

Cast is a swiss army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the
command line.

More documentation can be found in the [cast package](./cast).

## Configuration

### Using `foundry.toml`

Foundry is designed to be very configurable. You can configure Foundry using a file called
[`foundry.toml`](./config) in the root of your project, or any other parent
director. See
[config package](./config/README.md#all-options) for all available options.

Configuration can be arbitrarily namespaced by profiles. The default profile is named `default` (see ["Default Profile"](./config/README.md#default-profile)).

You can select another profile using the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
You can also override parts of your configuration using `FOUNDRY_` or `DAPP_` prefixed environment variables, like `FOUNDRY_SRC`.

`forge init` creates a basic, extendable `foundry.toml` file.

To see the your current configuration, run `forge config`. To see only basic
options (as set with `forge init`), run `forge config --basic`. This can be used
to create a new `foundry.toml` file with `forge config --basic > foundry.toml`.

By default `forge config` shows the currently selected foundry profile and its values. It also accepts the same arguments as `forge build`.

### DappTools Compatibility

You can re-use your `.dapprc` environment variabless by running `source .dapprc` beforehand using a Foundry tool.

### Additional Configuration

You can find additional setup and configurations guides in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book]:

- [Setting up VSCode][vscode-setup]
- [Shell autocompletions][shell-setup]

### Troubleshooting Installation

#### `libusb` error when running `forge`/`cast`

If you are using the binaries as released, you may see the following error on
MacOS:

```
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/libusb/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib
```

In order to fix this, you must install `libusb` like so:

```sh
brew install libusb
```

#### Out of date `GLIBC` error when running `forge` from default `foundryup` install:

If you run into an error resembling the following when using `foundryup`:

```
forge: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by forge)
```

There are 2 workarounds:

1. Building from source: ``foundryup -b master``
2. [Using Docker](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html#using-with-docker)
