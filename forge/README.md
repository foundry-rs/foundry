# `forge`

Forge is a fast and flexible Ethereum testing framework, inspired by
[Dapp](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/dapp).

If you are looking into how to consume the software as an end user, check the
[CLI README](../cli/README.md).

For more context on how the package works under the hood, look in the
[code docs](./src/lib.rs).

## Why?

### Write your tests in Solidity to minimize context switching

Writing tests in Javascript/Typescript while writing your smart contracts in
Solidity can be confusing. Forge lets you write your tests in Solidity, so you
can focus on what matters.

```solidity
contract Foo {
    uint256 public x = 1;
    function set(uint256 _x) external {
        x = _x;
    }

    function double() external {
        x = 2 * x;
    }
}

contract FooTest {
    Foo foo;

    // The state of the contract gets reset before each
    // test is run, with the `setUp()` function being called
    // each time after deployment.
    function setUp() public {
        foo = new Foo();
    }

    // A simple unit test
    function testDouble() public {
        require(foo.x() == 1);
        foo.double();
        require(foo.x() == 2);
    }
}
```

### Fuzzing: Go beyond unit testing

When testing smart contracts, fuzzing can uncover edge cases which would be hard
to manually detect with manual unit testing. We support fuzzing natively, where
any test function that takes >0 arguments will be fuzzed, using the
[proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest/1.0.0/proptest/) crate.

An example of how a fuzzed test would look like can be seen below:

```solidity
function testDoubleWithFuzzing(uint256 x) public {
    foo.set(x);
    require(foo.x() == x);
    foo.double();
    require(foo.x() == 2 * x);
}
```

### Gas Report

Foundry will show you a comprehensive gas report about your contracts. It returns the `min`, `average`, `median` and, `max` gas cost for every function. 

It looks at **all** the tests that make a call to a given function and records the associated gas costs. For example, if something calls a function and it reverts, that's propably the `min` value. Another example is the `max` value that is generated usually during the first call of the function (as it has to initialise storage, variables, etc.)

Usually, the `median` value is what your users will probably end up paying. `max` and `min` concern edge cases that you might want to explicitly test against, but users will probably never encounter.

### Cheat codes

_The below is modified from
[Dapp's README](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/hevm/README.md#cheat-codes)_

We allow modifying blockchain state with "cheat codes". These can be accessed by
calling into a contract at address `0x7109709ECfa91a80626fF3989D68f67F5b1DD12D`,
which implements the following methods:

- `function warp(uint x) public` Sets the block timestamp to `x`.

- `function roll(uint x) public` Sets the block number to `x`.

- `function store(address c, bytes32 loc, bytes32 val) public` Sets the slot
  `loc` of contract `c` to `val`.

- `function load(address c, bytes32 loc) public returns (bytes32 val)` Reads the
  slot `loc` of contract `c`.

- `function sign(uint sk, bytes32 digest) public returns (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)`
  Signs the `digest` using the private key `sk`. Note that signatures produced
  via `hevm.sign` will leak the private key.

- `function addr(uint sk) public returns (address addr)` Derives an ethereum
  address from the private key `sk`. Note that `hevm.addr(0)` will fail with
  `BadCheatCode` as `0` is an invalid ECDSA private key.

- `function ffi(string[] calldata) external returns (bytes memory)` Executes the
  arguments as a command in the system shell and returns stdout. Note that this
  cheatcode means test authors can execute arbitrary code on user machines as
  part of a call to `forge test`, for this reason all calls to `ffi` will fail
  unless the `--ffi` flag is passed.

- `function deal(address who, uint256 amount)`: Sets an account's balance

- `function etch(address where, bytes memory what)`: Sets the contract code at
  some address contract code

- `function prank(address sender)`: Performs the next smart contract call as another address (prank just changes msg.sender. Tx still occurs as normal)

- `function prank(address sender, address origin)`: Performs the next smart contract call setting both `msg.sender` and `tx.origin`.

- `function startPrank(address sender)`: Performs smart contract calls as another address. The account impersonation lasts until the end of the transaction, or until `stopPrank` is called.

- `function startPrank(address sender, address origin)`: Performs smart contract calls as another address, while also setting `tx.origin`. The account impersonation lasts until the end of the transaction, or until `stopPrank` is called.

- `function stopPrank()`: Stop calling smart contracts with the address set at `startPrank`

- `function expectRevert(<overloaded> expectedError)`:
  Tells the evm to expect that the next call reverts with specified error bytes. Valid input types: `bytes`, and `bytes4`. Implicitly, strings get converted to bytes except when shorter than 4, in which case you will need to cast explicitly to `bytes`.
  
- `function expectEmit(bool,bool,bool,bool) external`: Expects the next emitted event. Params check topic 1, topic 2, topic 3 and data are the same.

- `function getCode(string calldata) external returns (bytes memory)`: Fetches bytecode from a contract artifact. The parameter can either be in the form `ContractFile.sol` (if the filename and contract name are the same), `ContractFile.sol:ContractName`, or `./path/to/artifact.json`.

- `function label(address addr, string calldata label) external`: Label an address in test traces.

- `function assume(bool) external`: When fuzzing, generate new inputs if conditional not met

- `function setNonce(address account, uint64 nonce) external`: Set nonce for an account, increment only.

- `function getNonce(address account)`: Get nonce for an account.

The below example uses the `warp` cheatcode to override the timestamp & `expectRevert` to expect a specific revert string:

```solidity
interface Vm {
    function warp(uint256 x) external;
    function expectRevert(bytes calldata) external;
}

contract Foo {
    function bar(uint256 a) public returns (uint256) {
        require(a < 100, "My expected revert string");
        return a;
    }
}

contract MyTest {
    Vm vm = Vm(0x7109709ECfa91a80626fF3989D68f67F5b1DD12D);

    function testWarp() public {
        vm.warp(100);
        require(block.timestamp == 100);
    }

    function testBarExpectedRevert() public {
        vm.expectRevert("My expected revert string");
        // This would fail *if* we didnt expect revert. Since we expect the revert,
        // it doesn't, unless the revert string is wrong.
        foo.bar(101);
    }

    function testFailBar() public {
        // this call would revert, causing this test to pass
        foo.bar(101);
    }
}
```

Below is another example using the `expectEmit` cheatcode to check events:

```solidity
interface Vm {
    function expectEmit(bool,bool,bool,bool) external;
}

contract T is DSTest {
    Vm vm = Vm(HEVM_ADDRESS);
    event Transfer(address indexed from,address indexed to, uint256 amount);
    function testExpectEmit() public {
        ExpectEmit emitter = new ExpectEmit();
        // check topic 1, topic 2, and data are the same as the following emitted event
        vm.expectEmit(true,true,false,true);
        emit Transfer(address(this), address(1337), 1337);
        emitter.t();
    }
}

contract ExpectEmit {
    event Transfer(address indexed from,address indexed to, uint256 amount);
    function t() public {
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(1337), 1337);
    }
}
```

A full interface for all cheatcodes is here:
```solidity
interface Hevm {
    // Set block.timestamp (newTimestamp)
    function warp(uint256) external;
    // Set block.height (newHeight)
    function roll(uint256) external;
    // Set block.basefee (newBasefee)
    function fee(uint256) external;
    // Loads a storage slot from an address (who, slot)
    function load(address,bytes32) external returns (bytes32);
    // Stores a value to an address' storage slot, (who, slot, value)
    function store(address,bytes32,bytes32) external;
    // Signs data, (privateKey, digest) => (v, r, s)
    function sign(uint256,bytes32) external returns (uint8,bytes32,bytes32);
    // Gets address for a given private key, (privateKey) => (address)
    function addr(uint256) external returns (address);
    // Performs a foreign function call via terminal, (stringInputs) => (result)
    function ffi(string[] calldata) external returns (bytes memory);
    // Sets the *next* call's msg.sender to be the input address
    function prank(address) external;
    // Sets all subsequent calls' msg.sender to be the input address until `stopPrank` is called
    function startPrank(address) external;
    // Sets the *next* call's msg.sender to be the input address, and the tx.origin to be the second input
    function prank(address,address) external;
    // Sets all subsequent calls' msg.sender to be the input address until `stopPrank` is called, and the tx.origin to be the second input
    function startPrank(address,address) external;
    // Resets subsequent calls' msg.sender to be `address(this)`
    function stopPrank() external;
    // Sets an address' balance, (who, newBalance)
    function deal(address, uint256) external;
    // Sets an address' code, (who, newCode)
    function etch(address, bytes calldata) external;
    // Expects an error on next call
    function expectRevert() external;
    function expectRevert(bytes calldata) external;
    function expectRevert(bytes4) external;
    // Record all storage reads and writes
    function record() external;
    // Gets all accessed reads and write slot from a recording session, for a given address
    function accesses(address) external returns (bytes32[] memory reads, bytes32[] memory writes);
    // Prepare an expected log with (bool checkTopic1, bool checkTopic2, bool checkTopic3, bool checkData).
    // Call this function, then emit an event, then call a function. Internally after the call, we check if
    // logs were emitted in the expected order with the expected topics and data (as specified by the booleans)
    function expectEmit(bool,bool,bool,bool) external;
    // Mocks a call to an address, returning specified data.
    // Calldata can either be strict or a partial match, e.g. if you only
    // pass a Solidity selector to the expected calldata, then the entire Solidity
    // function will be mocked.
    function mockCall(address,bytes calldata,bytes calldata) external;
    // Clears all mocked calls
    function clearMockedCalls() external;
    // Expect a call to an address with the specified calldata.
    // Calldata can either be strict or a partial match
    function expectCall(address,bytes calldata) external;
    // Fetches the contract bytecode from its artifact file
    function getCode(string calldata) external returns (bytes memory);
    // Label an address in test traces
    function label(address addr, string calldata label) external;
    // When fuzzing, generate new inputs if conditional not met
    function assume(bool) external;
    // Set nonce for an account, increment only
    function setNonce(address,uint64) external;
    // Get nonce for an account
    function getNonce(address) external returns(uint64);
}
```
### `console.log`


We support the logging functionality from Hardhat's `console.log`.

If you are on a hardhat project, `import hardhat/console.sol` should just work if you use `forge test --hh`.

If no, there is an implementation contract [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/master/packages/hardhat-core/console.sol). We currently recommend that you copy this contract, place it in your `test` folder, and import it into the contract where you wish to use `console.log`, though there should be more streamlined functionality soon.

Usage follows the same format as [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#console-log):
```solidity
import "./console.sol";
...
console.log(someValue);

```

Note: to make logs visible in `stdout`, you must use at least level 2 verbosity.
```bash
$> forge test -vv
[PASS] test1() (gas: 7683)
...
Logs:
  <your log string or event>
  ...
```

## Remappings
If you are working in a repo with NPM-style imports, like
```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
```

then you will need to create a `remappings.txt` file at the top level of your project directory, so that Forge knows where to find these dependencies. 

For example, if you have `@openzeppelin` imports, you would 

1. `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts` (this will add the repo to `lib/openzepplin-contracts`)
2. Create a remappings file: `touch remappings.txt`
3. Add this line to `remappings.txt`  
```
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```

## Github Actions CI

We recommend using the [Github Actions CI setup](https://github.com/FrankieIsLost/forge-template/blob/2ff5ae4ea40d77d4aa4e8353e0a878478ec9df24/.github/workflows/CI.yml) from @FrankieIsLost's [forge-template](https://github.com/FrankieIsLost/forge-template).

## Future Features

### Dapptools feature parity

Over the next months, we intend to add the following features which are
available in upstream dapptools:

1. Stack Traces: Currently we do not provide any debug information when a call
   fails. We intend to add a structured printer (something like
   [this](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1434337110111182848) which will
   show all the calls, logs and arguments passed across intermediate smart
   contract calls, which should help with debugging.
1. [Invariant Tests](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/dapp/README.md#invariant-testing)
1. [Interactive Debugger](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/hevm/README.md#interactive-debugger-key-bindings)
1. [Code coverage](https://twitter.com/dapptools/status/1435973810545729536)
1. [Gas snapshots](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/pull/850/files)
1. [Symbolic EVM](https://fv.ethereum.org/2020/07/28/symbolic-hevm-release/)

### Unique features?

We also intend to add features which are not available in dapptools:

1. Even faster tests with parallel EVM execution that produces state diffs
   instead of modifying the state
1. Improved UX for assertions:
   1. Check revert error or reason on a Solidity call
   1. Check that an event was emitted with expected arguments
1. Support more EVM backends ([revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/), geth's
   evm, hevm etc.) & benchmark performance across them
1. Declarative deployment system based on a config file
1. Formatting & Linting (maybe powered by
   [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang))
   1. `forge fmt`, an automatic code formatter according to standard rules (like
      [`prettier-plugin-solidity`](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity))
   1. `forge lint`, a linter + static analyzer, like a combination of
      [`solhint`](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) and
      [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither/)
1. Flamegraphs for gas profiling
