The daily test-isolate workflow (tests with isolation mode enabled) has failed. This indicates a regression in Foundry's test isolation behavior.

Check the [test-isolate workflow page]({{ env.WORKFLOW_URL }}) for details.

This issue was raised by the workflow at `.github/workflows/test-isolate.yml`.
