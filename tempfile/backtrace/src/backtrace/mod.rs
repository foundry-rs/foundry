/// Inspects the current call-stack, passing all active frames into the closure
/// provided to calculate a stack trace.
///
/// This function is the workhorse of this library in calculating the stack
/// traces for a program. The given closure `cb` is yielded instances of a
/// `Frame` which represent information about that call frame on the stack. The
/// closure is yielded frames in a top-down fashion (most recently called
/// functions first).
///
/// The closure's return value is an indication of whether the backtrace should
/// continue. A return value of `false` will terminate the backtrace and return
/// immediately.
///
/// Once a `Frame` is acquired you will likely want to call `backtrace::resolve`
/// to convert the `ip` (instruction pointer) or symbol address to a `Symbol`
/// through which the name and/or filename/line number can be learned.
///
/// Note that this is a relatively low-level function and if you'd like to, for
/// example, capture a backtrace to be inspected later, then the `Backtrace`
/// type may be more appropriate.
///
/// # Required features
///
/// This function requires the `std` feature of the `backtrace` crate to be
/// enabled, and the `std` feature is enabled by default.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function strives to never panic, but if the `cb` provided panics then
/// some platforms will force a double panic to abort the process. Some
/// platforms use a C library which internally uses callbacks which cannot be
/// unwound through, so panicking from `cb` may trigger a process abort.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// extern crate backtrace;
///
/// fn main() {
///     backtrace::trace(|frame| {
///         // ...
///
///         true // continue the backtrace
///     });
/// }
/// ```
