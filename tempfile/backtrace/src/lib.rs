//! A library for acquiring a backtrace at runtime
//!
//! This library is meant to supplement the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` support of the
//! standard library by allowing an acquisition of a backtrace at runtime
//! programmatically. The backtraces generated by this library do not need to be
//! parsed, for example, and expose the functionality of multiple backend
//! implementations.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! First, add this to your Cargo.toml
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! backtrace = "0.3"
//! ```
//!
//! Next:
//!
//! ```
//! fn main() {
//! # // Unsafe here so test passes on no_std.
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")] {
//!     backtrace::trace(|frame| {
//!         let ip = frame.ip();
//!         let symbol_address = frame.symbol_address();
//!
//!         // Resolve this instruction pointer to a symbol name
//!         backtrace::resolve_frame(frame, |symbol| {
//!             if let Some(name) = symbol.name() {
//!                 // ...
//!             }
//!             if let Some(filename) = symbol.filename() {
//!                 // ...
//!             }
//!         });
//!
//!         true // keep going to the next frame
//!     });
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Backtrace accuracy
//!
//! This crate implements best-effort attempts to get the native backtrace. This
//! is not always guaranteed to work, and some platforms don't return any
//! backtrace at all. If your application requires accurate backtraces then it's
//! recommended to closely evaluate this crate to see whether it's suitable
//! for your use case on your target platforms.
//!
//! Even on supported platforms, there's a number of reasons that backtraces may
//! be less-than-accurate, including but not limited to:
//!
//! * Unwind information may not be available. This crate primarily implements
//!   backtraces by unwinding the stack, but not all functions may have
//!   unwinding information (e.g. DWARF unwinding information).
//!
//! * Rust code may be compiled without unwinding information for some
//!   functions. This can also happen for Rust code compiled with
//!   `-Cpanic=abort`. You can remedy this, however, with
//!   `-Cforce-unwind-tables` as a compiler option.
//!
//! * Unwind information may be inaccurate or corrupt. In the worst case
//!   inaccurate unwind information can lead this library to segfault. In the
//!   best case inaccurate information will result in a truncated stack trace.
//!
//! * Backtraces may not report filenames/line numbers correctly due to missing
//!   or corrupt debug information. This won't lead to segfaults unlike corrupt
//!   unwinding information, but missing or malformed debug information will
//!   mean that filenames and line numbers will not be available. This may be
//!   because debug information wasn't generated by the compiler, or it's just
//!   missing on the filesystem.
//!
//! * Not all platforms are supported. For example there's no way to get a
//!   backtrace on WebAssembly at the moment.
//!
//! * Crate features may be disabled. Currently this crate supports using Gimli
//!   libbacktrace on non-Windows platforms for reading debuginfo for
//!   backtraces. If both crate features are disabled, however, then these
//!   platforms will generate a backtrace but be unable to generate symbols for
//!   it.
//!
//! In most standard workflows for most standard platforms you generally don't
//! need to worry about these caveats. We'll try to fix ones where we can over
//! time, but otherwise it's important to be aware of the limitations of
//! unwinding-based backtraces!
