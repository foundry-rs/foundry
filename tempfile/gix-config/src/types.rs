/// key `a` with the above config will fetch `d` or replace `d`, since the last
/// valid config key/value pair is `a = d`:
///
/// # Filtering
///
/// All methods exist in a `*_filter(â€¦, filter)` version to allow skipping sections by
/// their metadata. That way it's possible to select values based on their `gix_sec::Trust`
/// for example, or by their location.
///
/// Note that the filter may be executed even on sections that don't contain the key in question,
/// even though the section will have matched the `name` and `subsection_name` respectively.

/// ```
///
/// Consider the `multi` variants of the methods instead, if you want to work
/// with all values.

/// only sections and their names, as well as all of their values. The ordering matters, of course.
