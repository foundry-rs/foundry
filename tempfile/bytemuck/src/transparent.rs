/// A trait which indicates that a type is a `#[repr(transparent)]` wrapper
/// around the `Inner` value.
///
/// This allows safely copy transmuting between the `Inner` type and the
/// `TransparentWrapper` type. Functions like `wrap_{}` convert from the inner
/// type to the wrapper type and `peel_{}` functions do the inverse conversion
/// from the wrapper type to the inner type. We deliberately do not call the
/// wrapper-removing methods "unwrap" because at this point that word is too
/// strongly tied to the Option/ Result methods.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The safety contract of `TransparentWrapper` is relatively simple:
///
/// For a given `Wrapper` which implements `TransparentWrapper<Inner>`:
///
/// 1. `Wrapper` must be a wrapper around `Inner` with an identical data
///    representations. This    either means that it must be a
///    `#[repr(transparent)]` struct which    contains a either a field of type
///    `Inner` (or a field of some other    transparent wrapper for `Inner`) as
///    the only non-ZST field.
///
/// 2. Any fields *other* than the `Inner` field must be trivially constructable
///    ZSTs, for example `PhantomData`, `PhantomPinned`, etc. (When deriving
///    `TransparentWrapper` on a type with ZST fields, the ZST fields must be
///    [`Zeroable`]).
///
/// 3. The `Wrapper` may not impose additional alignment requirements over
///    `Inner`.
///     - Note: this is currently guaranteed by `repr(transparent)`, but there
///       have been discussions of lifting it, so it's stated here explicitly.
///
/// 4. All functions on `TransparentWrapper` **may not** be overridden.
///
/// ## Caveats
///
/// If the wrapper imposes additional constraints upon the inner type which are
/// required for safety, it's responsible for ensuring those still hold -- this
/// generally requires preventing access to instances of the inner type, as
/// implementing `TransparentWrapper<U> for T` means anybody can call
/// `T::cast_ref(any_instance_of_u)`.
///
/// For example, it would be invalid to implement TransparentWrapper for `str`
/// to implement `TransparentWrapper` around `[u8]` because of this.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic
///
/// ```
/// use bytemuck::TransparentWrapper;
/// # #[derive(Default)]
/// # struct SomeStruct(u32);
///
/// #[repr(transparent)]
/// struct MyWrapper(SomeStruct);
///
/// unsafe impl TransparentWrapper<SomeStruct> for MyWrapper {}
///
/// // interpret a reference to &SomeStruct as a &MyWrapper
/// let thing = SomeStruct::default();
/// let inner_ref: &MyWrapper = MyWrapper::wrap_ref(&thing);
///
/// // Works with &mut too.
/// let mut mut_thing = SomeStruct::default();
/// let inner_mut: &mut MyWrapper = MyWrapper::wrap_mut(&mut mut_thing);
///
/// # let _ = (inner_ref, inner_mut); // silence warnings
/// ```
///
/// ## Use with dynamically sized types
///
/// ```
/// use bytemuck::TransparentWrapper;
///
/// #[repr(transparent)]
/// struct Slice<T>([T]);
///
/// unsafe impl<T> TransparentWrapper<[T]> for Slice<T> {}
///
/// let s = Slice::wrap_ref(&[1u32, 2, 3]);
/// assert_eq!(&s.0, &[1, 2, 3]);
///
/// let mut buf = [1, 2, 3u8];
/// let sm = Slice::wrap_mut(&mut buf);
/// ```
///
/// ## Deriving
///
/// When deriving, the non-wrapped fields must uphold all the normal
/// requirements, and must also be `Zeroable`.
