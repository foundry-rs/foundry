/// A trait indicating that:
///
/// 1. A type has an equivalent representation to some known integral type.
/// 2. All instances of this type fall in a fixed range of values.
/// 3. Within that range, there are no gaps.
///
/// This is generally useful for fieldless enums (aka "c-style" enums), however
/// it's important that it only be used for those with an explicit `#[repr]`, as
/// `#[repr(Rust)]` fieldess enums have an unspecified layout.
///
/// Additionally, you shouldn't assume that all implementations are enums. Any
/// type which meets the requirements above while following the rules under
/// "Safety" below is valid.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// # use bytemuck::Contiguous;
/// #[repr(u8)]
/// #[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq)]
/// enum Foo {
///   A = 0,
///   B = 1,
///   C = 2,
///   D = 3,
///   E = 4,
/// }
/// unsafe impl Contiguous for Foo {
///   type Int = u8;
///   const MIN_VALUE: u8 = Foo::A as u8;
///   const MAX_VALUE: u8 = Foo::E as u8;
/// }
/// assert_eq!(Foo::from_integer(3).unwrap(), Foo::D);
/// assert_eq!(Foo::from_integer(8), None);
/// assert_eq!(Foo::C.into_integer(), 2);
/// ```
/// # Safety
///
/// This is an unsafe trait, and incorrectly implementing it is undefined
/// behavior.
///
/// Informally, by implementing it, you're asserting that `C` is identical to
/// the integral type `C::Int`, and that every `C` falls between `C::MIN_VALUE`
/// and `C::MAX_VALUE` exactly once, without any gaps.
///
/// Precisely, the guarantees you must uphold when implementing `Contiguous` for
/// some type `C` are:
///
/// 1. The sizeÂ of `C` and `C::Int` must be the same, and neither may be a ZST.
///    (Note: alignment is explicitly allowed to differ)
///
/// 2. `C::Int` must be a primitive integer, and not a wrapper type. In the
///    future, this may be lifted to include cases where the behavior is
///    identical for a relevant set of traits (Ord, arithmetic, ...).
///
/// 3. All `C::Int`s which are in the *inclusive* range between `C::MIN_VALUE`
///    and `C::MAX_VALUE` are bitwise identical to unique valid instances of
///    `C`.
///
/// 4. There exist no instances of `C` such that their bitpatterns, when
///    interpreted as instances of `C::Int`, fall outside of the `MAX_VALUE` /
///    `MIN_VALUE` range -- It is legal for unsafe code to assume that if it
///    gets a `C` that implements `Contiguous`, it is in the appropriate range.
///
/// 5. Finally, you promise not to provide overridden implementations of
///    `Contiguous::from_integer` and `Contiguous::into_integer`.
///
/// For clarity, the following rules could be derived from the above, but are
/// listed explicitly:
///
/// - `C::MAX_VALUE` must be greater or equal to `C::MIN_VALUE` (therefore, `C`
///   must be an inhabited type).
///
/// - There exist no two values between `MIN_VALUE` and `MAX_VALUE` such that
///   when interpreted as a `C` they are considered identical (by, say, match).

  /// type.

  /// Contiguous is broadly intended for use with fieldless enums, and for

  /// `#[repr(Int)]` or `#[repr(C)]` attribute, (if it does not, it is
  /// *unsound* to implement `Contiguous`!).

  /// - For `#[repr(Int)]`, use the listed `Int`. e.g. `#[repr(u8)]` should use
  ///   `type Int = u8`.

  ///   represent the given enum. This is usually `c_int` (from `std::os::raw`
  ///   or `libc`), but it's up to you to make the determination as the
