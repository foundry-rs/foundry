//! This crate gives small utilities for casting between plain data types.
//!
//! ## Basics
//!
//! Data comes in five basic forms in Rust, so we have five basic casting
//! functions:
//!
//! * `T` uses [`cast`]
//! * `&T` uses [`cast_ref`]
//! * `&mut T` uses [`cast_mut`]
//! * `&[T]` uses [`cast_slice`]
//! * `&mut [T]` uses [`cast_slice_mut`]
//!
//! Depending on the function, the [`NoUninit`] and/or [`AnyBitPattern`] traits
//! are used to maintain memory safety.
//!
//! **Historical Note:** When the crate first started the [`Pod`] trait was used
//! instead, and so you may hear people refer to that, but it has the strongest
//! requirements and people eventually wanted the more fine-grained system, so
//! here we are. All types that impl `Pod` have a blanket impl to also support
//! `NoUninit` and `AnyBitPattern`. The traits unfortunately do not have a
//! perfectly clean hierarchy for semver reasons.
//!
//! ## Failures
//!
//! Some casts will never fail, and other casts might fail.
//!
//! * `cast::<u32, f32>` always works (and [`f32::from_bits`]).
//! * `cast_ref::<[u8; 4], u32>` might fail if the specific array reference
//!   given at runtime doesn't have alignment 4.
//!
//! In addition to the "normal" forms of each function, which will panic on
//! invalid input, there's also `try_` versions which will return a `Result`.
//!
//! If you would like to statically ensure that a cast will work at runtime you
//! can use the `must_cast` crate feature and the `must_` casting functions. A
//! "must cast" that can't be statically known to be valid will cause a
//! compilation error (and sometimes a very hard to read compilation error).
//!
//! ## Using Your Own Types
//!
//! All the functions listed above are guarded by the [`Pod`] trait, which is a
//! sub-trait of the [`Zeroable`] trait.
//!
//! If you enable the crate's `derive` feature then these traits can be derived
//! on your own types. The derive macros will perform the necessary checks on
//! your type declaration, and trigger an error if your type does not qualify.
//!
//! The derive macros might not cover all edge cases, and sometimes they will
//! error when actually everything is fine. As a last resort you can impl these
//! traits manually. However, these traits are `unsafe`, and you should
//! carefully read the requirements before using a manual implementation.
//!
//! ## Cargo Features
//!
//! The crate supports Rust 1.34 when no features are enabled, and so there's
//! cargo features for thing that you might consider "obvious".
//!
//! The cargo features **do not** promise any particular MSRV, and they may
//! increase their MSRV in new versions.
//!
//! * `derive`: Provide derive macros for the various traits.
//! * `extern_crate_alloc`: Provide utilities for `alloc` related types such as
//!   Box and Vec.
//! * `zeroable_maybe_uninit` and `zeroable_atomics`: Provide more [`Zeroable`]
//!   impls.
//! * `wasm_simd` and `aarch64_simd`: Support more SIMD types.
//! * `min_const_generics`: Provides appropriate impls for arrays of all lengths
//!   instead of just for a select list of array lengths.
//! * `must_cast`: Provides the `must_` functions, which will compile error if
//!   the requested cast can't be statically verified.
//! * `const_zeroed`: Provides a const version of the `zeroed` function.
