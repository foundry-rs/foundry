//! **Transactions** are the only way make changes to the ref store in order to increase the chance of consistency in a multi-threaded
//! environment.
//!
//! Transactions currently allow toâ€¦
//!
//! * create or update reference
//! * delete references
//!
//! The following guarantees are made:
//!
//! * transactions are prepared which is when other writers are prevented from changing them
//!   - errors during preparations will cause a perfect rollback
//! * prepared transactions are committed to finalize the change
//!   - errors when committing while leave the ref store in an inconsistent, but operational state.
