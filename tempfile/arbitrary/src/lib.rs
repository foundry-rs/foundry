/// The `Arbitrary` trait allows you to generate valid structured values, like
/// `HashMap`s, or ASTs, or `MyTomlConfig`, or any other data structure from
/// raw, unstructured bytes provided by a fuzzer.
///
/// # Deriving `Arbitrary`
///
/// Automatically deriving the `Arbitrary` trait is the recommended way to
/// implement `Arbitrary` for your types.
///
/// Using the custom derive requires that you enable the `"derive"` cargo
/// feature in your `Cargo.toml`:
///
/// ```toml
/// [dependencies]
/// arbitrary = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
/// ```
///
/// Then, you add the `#[derive(Arbitrary)]` annotation to your `struct` or
/// `enum` type definition:
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(feature = "derive")] mod foo {
/// use arbitrary::Arbitrary;
/// use std::collections::HashSet;
///
/// #[derive(Arbitrary)]
/// pub struct AddressBook {
///     friends: HashSet<Friend>,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Arbitrary, Hash, Eq, PartialEq)]
/// pub enum Friend {
///     Buddy { name: String },
///     Pal { age: usize },
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Every member of the `struct` or `enum` must also implement `Arbitrary`.
///
/// It is also possible to change the default bounds added by the derive:
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(feature = "derive")] mod foo {
/// use arbitrary::Arbitrary;
///
/// trait Trait {
///     type Assoc: for<'a> Arbitrary<'a>;
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Arbitrary)]
/// // The bounds are used verbatim, so any existing trait bounds will need to be repeated.
/// #[arbitrary(bound = "T: Trait")]
/// struct Point<T: Trait> {
///     x: T::Assoc,
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Implementing `Arbitrary` By Hand
///
/// Implementing `Arbitrary` mostly involves nested calls to other `Arbitrary`
/// arbitrary implementations for each of your `struct` or `enum`'s members. But
/// sometimes you need some amount of raw data, or you need to generate a
/// variably-sized collection type, or something of that sort. The
/// [`Unstructured`] type helps you with these tasks.
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(feature = "derive")] mod foo {
/// # pub struct MyCollection<T> { _t: std::marker::PhantomData<T> }
/// # impl<T> MyCollection<T> {
/// #     pub fn new() -> Self { MyCollection { _t: std::marker::PhantomData } }
/// #     pub fn insert(&mut self, element: T) {}
/// # }
/// use arbitrary::{Arbitrary, Result, Unstructured};
///
/// impl<'a, T> Arbitrary<'a> for MyCollection<T>
/// where
///     T: Arbitrary<'a>,
/// {
///     fn arbitrary(u: &mut Unstructured<'a>) -> Result<Self> {
///         // Get an iterator of arbitrary `T`s.
///         let iter = u.arbitrary_iter::<T>()?;
///
///         // And then create a collection!
///         let mut my_collection = MyCollection::new();
///         for elem_result in iter {
///             let elem = elem_result?;
///             my_collection.insert(elem);
///         }
///
///         Ok(my_collection)
///     }
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # A Note On Output Distributions
///
/// There is no requirement for a particular distribution of the values. For
/// example, it is not required that every value appears with the same
/// probability. That being said, the main use for `Arbitrary` is for fuzzing,
/// so in many cases a uniform distribution will make the most sense in order to
/// provide the best coverage of the domain. In other cases this is not
/// desirable or even possible, for example when sampling from a uniform
/// distribution is computationally expensive or in the case of collections that
/// may grow indefinitely.
pub trait Arbitrary<'a>: Sized {
    /// Generate an arbitrary value of `Self` from the given unstructured data.
    ///
    /// Calling `Arbitrary::arbitrary` requires that you have some raw data,
    /// perhaps given to you by a fuzzer like AFL or libFuzzer. You wrap this
    /// raw data in an `Unstructured`, and then you can call `<MyType as
    /// Arbitrary>::arbitrary` to construct an arbitrary instance of `MyType`

    ///
    /// Implementations may return an error if there is not enough data to
    /// construct a full instance of `Self`, or they may fill out the rest of

    /// exhausted can help avoid accidentally "defeating" some of the fuzzer's
    /// mutations to the underlying byte stream that might otherwise lead to
    /// interesting runtime behavior or new code coverage if only we had just a
    /// few more bytes. However, it also requires that implementations for
    /// recursive types (e.g. `struct Foo(Option<Box<Foo>>)`) avoid infinite
    /// recursion when the underlying data is exhausted.
