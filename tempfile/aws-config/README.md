# aws-config

AWS SDK config and credential provider implementations.

 The implementations can be used either via the default chain implementation `from_env`/`ConfigLoader` or ad-hoc individual credential and region providers.

A `ConfigLoader` can combine different configuration sources into an AWS shared-config `Config`. The `Config` can then be used to configure one or more AWS service clients.

## Examples

Load default SDK configuration:

```rust
async fn example() {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_dynamodb::Client::new(&config);
}
```

Load SDK configuration with a region override:

```rust
use aws_config::meta::region::RegionProviderChain;

async fn example() {
    let region_provider = RegionProviderChain::default_provider().or_else("us-east-1");
    let config = aws_config::from_env().region(region_provider).load().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_dynamodb::Client::new(&config);
}
```

## Getting Started

_Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the [examples folder in GitHub][Usage examples]._

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio] as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add aws-sdk-config to your project, add the following to your Cargo.toml file where VERSION is the version of the SDK you want to use:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "VERSION"
aws-sdk-config = "VERSION"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Detailed usage instructions are available in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html).
Suggestions for additional sections or improvements for the guide are welcome. Please open an issue describing what you are trying to do.
