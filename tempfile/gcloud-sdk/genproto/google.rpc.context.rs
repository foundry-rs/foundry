/// An attribute is a piece of metadata that describes an activity on a network
/// service. For example, the size of an HTTP request, or the status code of
/// an HTTP response.
///
/// Each attribute has a type and a name, which is logically defined as
/// a proto message field in `AttributeContext`. The field type becomes the
/// attribute type, and the field path becomes the attribute name. For example,
/// the attribute `source.ip` maps to field `AttributeContext.source.ip`.
///
/// This message definition is guaranteed not to have any wire breaking change.
/// So you can use it directly for passing attributes across different systems.
///
/// NOTE: Different system may generate different subset of attributes. Please
/// verify the system specification before relying on an attribute generated
/// a system.
