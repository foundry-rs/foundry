The key type defaults to ALL on a HTTP session. - REGION_CODE: The country/region from which the request originates. - TLS_JA3_FINGERPRINT: JA3 TLS/SSL fingerprint if the client connects using HTTPS, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3. If not available, the key type defaults to ALL. - USER_IP: The IP address of the originating client, which is resolved based on \"userIpRequestHeaders\" configured with the security policy. If there is no \"userIpRequestHeaders\" configuration or an IP address cannot be resolved from it, the key type defaults to IP.
