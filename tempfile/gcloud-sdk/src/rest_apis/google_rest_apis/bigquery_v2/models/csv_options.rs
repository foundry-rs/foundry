This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
