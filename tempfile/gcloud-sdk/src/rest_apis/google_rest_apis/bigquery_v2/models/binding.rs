Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`.
