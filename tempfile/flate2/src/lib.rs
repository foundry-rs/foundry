//! A DEFLATE-based stream compression/decompression library
//!
//! This library provides support for compression and decompression of
//! DEFLATE-based streams:
//!
//! * the DEFLATE format itself
//! * the zlib format
//! * gzip
//!
//! These three formats are all closely related and largely only differ in their
//! headers/footers. This crate has three types in each submodule for dealing
//! with these three formats.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! In addition to supporting three formats, this crate supports several different
//! backends, controlled through this crate's features:
//!
//! * `default`, or `rust_backend` - this implementation uses the `miniz_oxide`
//!   crate which is a port of `miniz.c` (below) to Rust. This feature does not
//!   require a C compiler and only requires Rust code.
//!
//! * `zlib` - this feature will enable linking against the `libz` library, typically found on most
//!   Linux systems by default. If the library isn't found to already be on the system it will be
//!   compiled from source (this is a C library).
//!
//! There's various tradeoffs associated with each implementation, but in general you probably
//! won't have to tweak the defaults. The default choice is selected to avoid the need for a C
//! compiler at build time. `zlib-ng-compat` is useful if you're using zlib for compatibility but
//! want performance via zlib-ng's zlib-compat mode. `zlib` is useful if something else in your
//! dependencies links the original zlib so you cannot use zlib-ng-compat. The compression ratios
//! and performance of each of these feature should be roughly comparable, but you'll likely want
//! to run your own tests if you're curious about the performance.
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! This crate consists mainly of three modules, [`read`], [`write`], and
//! [`bufread`]. Each module contains a number of types used to encode and
//! decode various streams of data.
//!
//! All types in the [`write`] module work on instances of [`Write`][write],
//! whereas all types in the [`read`] module work on instances of
//! [`Read`][read] and [`bufread`] works with [`BufRead`][bufread]. If you
//! are decoding directly from a `&[u8]`, use the [`bufread`] types.
//!
//! ```
//! use flate2::write::GzEncoder;
//! use flate2::Compression;
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//!
//! # fn main() { let _ = run(); }
//! # fn run() -> io::Result<()> {
//! let mut encoder = GzEncoder::new(Vec::new(), Compression::default());
//! encoder.write_all(b"Example")?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! Other various types are provided at the top-level of the crate for
//! management and dealing with encoders/decoders. Also note that types which
//! operate over a specific trait often implement the mirroring trait as well.
//! For example a `flate2::read::DeflateDecoder<T>` *also* implements the
//! `Write` trait if `T: Write`. That is, the "dual trait" is forwarded directly
//! to the underlying object if available.
//!
//! # About multi-member Gzip files
//!
//! While most `gzip` files one encounters will have a single *member* that can be read
//! with the [`GzDecoder`], there may be some files which have multiple members.
//!
//! A [`GzDecoder`] will only read the first member of gzip data, which may unexpectedly
//! provide partial results when a multi-member gzip file is encountered. `GzDecoder` is appropriate
//! for data that is designed to be read as single members from a multi-member file. `bufread::GzDecoder`
//! and `write::GzDecoder` also allow non-gzip data following gzip data to be handled.
//!
//! The [`MultiGzDecoder`] on the other hand will decode all members of a `gzip` file
//! into one consecutive stream of bytes, which hides the underlying *members* entirely.
//! If a file contains non-gzip data after the gzip data, MultiGzDecoder will
//! emit an error after decoding the gzip data. This behavior matches the `gzip`,
//! `gunzip`, and `zcat` command line tools.
