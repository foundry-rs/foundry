# inotify-rs [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/inotify.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/inotify) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/inotify/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/inotify) [![Rust](https://github.com/hannobraun/inotify-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hannobraun/inotify-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Idiomatic [inotify] wrapper for the [Rust programming language].

```Rust
extern crate inotify;


use std::env;

use inotify::{
    EventMask,
    WatchMask,
    Inotify,
};


fn main() {
    let mut inotify = Inotify::init()
        .expect("Failed to initialize inotify");

    let current_dir = env::current_dir()
        .expect("Failed to determine current directory");

    inotify
        .add_watch(
            current_dir,
            WatchMask::MODIFY | WatchMask::CREATE | WatchMask::DELETE,
        )
        .expect("Failed to add inotify watch");

    println!("Watching current directory for activity...");

    let mut buffer = [0u8; 4096];
    loop {
        let events = inotify
            .read_events_blocking(&mut buffer)
            .expect("Failed to read inotify events");

        for event in events {
            if event.mask.contains(EventMask::CREATE) {
                if event.mask.contains(EventMask::ISDIR) {
                    println!("Directory created: {:?}", event.name);
                } else {
                    println!("File created: {:?}", event.name);
                }
            } else if event.mask.contains(EventMask::DELETE) {
                if event.mask.contains(EventMask::ISDIR) {
                    println!("Directory deleted: {:?}", event.name);
                } else {
                    println!("File deleted: {:?}", event.name);
                }
            } else if event.mask.contains(EventMask::MODIFY) {
                if event.mask.contains(EventMask::ISDIR) {
                    println!("Directory modified: {:?}", event.name);
                } else {
                    println!("File modified: {:?}", event.name);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


## Usage

Include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
inotify = "0.9"
```

Please refer to the [documentation] and the example above, for information on how to use it in your code.

Please note that inotify-rs is a relatively low-level wrapper around the original inotify API. And, of course, it is Linux-specific, just like inotify itself. If you are looking for a higher-level and platform-independent file system notification library, please consider [notify].

If you need to access inotify in a way that this wrapper doesn't support, consider using [inotify-sys] instead.


## Documentation

The most important piece of documentation for inotify-rs is the **[API reference]**, as it contains a thorough description of the complete API, as well as examples.

Additional examples can be found in the **[examples directory]**.

Please also make sure to read the **[inotify man page]**. Inotify use can be hard to get right, and this low-level wrapper won't protect you from all mistakes.
