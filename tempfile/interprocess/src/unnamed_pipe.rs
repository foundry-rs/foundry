//! Creation and usage of unnamed pipes.
//!
//! Unlike named pipes, unnamed pipes are only accessible through their handles â€“ once an endpoint
//! is closed, its corresponding end of the pipe is no longer accessible. Unnamed pipes typically
//! work best when communicating with child processes.
//!
//! The handles and file descriptors are inheritable by default. The `AsRawHandle` and `AsRawFd`
//! traits can be used to get a numeric handle value which can then be communicated to a child
//! process using a command-line argument, environment variable or some other program startup IPC
//! method. The numeric value can then be reconstructed into an I/O object using
//! `FromRawHandle`/`FromRawFd`. Interprocess does not concern itself with how this is done.
//!
//! Note
//! [the standard library's support for piping `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`](std::process::Stdio),
//! which can be used in simple cases instead of unnamed pipes. Making use of that feature is
//! advisable if the program of the child process can be modified to communicate with its parent
//! via standard I/O streams.
//!
//! # Examples
//! See [`pipe()`].
