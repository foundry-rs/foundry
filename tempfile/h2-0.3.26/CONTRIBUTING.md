# Contributing to _h2_ #

:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project!

## Getting Help ##

If you have a question about the h2 library or have encountered problems using it, you may
[file an issue][issue] or ask a question on the [Tokio Gitter][gitter].

## Submitting a Pull Request ##

Do you have an improvement?

1. Submit an [issue][issue] describing your proposed change.
2. We will try to respond to your issue promptly.
3. Fork this repo, develop and test your code changes. See the project's [README](README.md) for further information about working in this repository.
4. Submit a pull request against this repo's `master` branch.
5. Your branch may be merged once all configured checks pass, including:
    - Code review has been completed.
    - The branch has passed tests in CI.

## Committing ##

When initially submitting a pull request, we prefer a single squashed commit. It
is preferable to split up contributions into multiple pull requests if the
changes are unrelated. All pull requests are squashed when merged, but
squashing yourself gives you better control over the commit message.

After the pull request is submitted, all changes should be done in separate
commits. This makes reviewing the evolution of the pull request easier. We will
squash all the changes into a single commit when we merge the pull request.

### Commit messages ###

Finalized commit messages should be in the following format:

```
Subject

Problem

Solution

Validation
```

#### Subject ####

- one line, <= 50 characters
- describe what is done; not the result
- use the active voice
- capitalize first word and proper nouns
- do not end in a period â€” this is a title/subject
- reference the github issue by number

##### Examples #####

```
bad: server disconnects should cause dst client disconnects.
good: Propagate disconnects from source to destination
```

```
bad: support tls servers
good: Introduce support for server-side TLS (#347)
```

#### Problem ####

Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
thought of as being the motivation for your change.

#### Solution ####

Describe the modifications you've made.

#### Validation ####

Describe the testing you've done to validate your change.  Performance-related
changes should include before- and after- benchmark results.
