description = "The `inlinable_string` crate provides the `InlinableString` type -- an owned, grow-able UTF-8 string that stores small strings inline and avoids heap-allocation -- and the `StringExt` trait which abstracts string operations over both `std::string::String` and `InlinableString` (or even your own custom string type)."
