/// <p>Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the <code>CreateKey</code> operation.</p>
/// <p>This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html">Multi-Region keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>A <i>replica key</i> is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id">key ID</a> and key material. They also have the same <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec">key spec</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage">key usage</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin">key material origin</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html">automatic key rotation status</a>. KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html">key policy</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html">tags</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html">aliases</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">Key states of KMS keys</a>. KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.</p>
/// <p>When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of <code>Creating</code>. This key state changes to <code>Enabled</code> (or <code>PendingImport</code>) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is <code>Creating</code>, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on <code>KMSInvalidStateException</code> or call <code>DescribeKey</code> to check its <code>KeyState</code> value before using it. For details about the <code>Creating</code> key state, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">Key states of KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any Region. If the Region already includes a replica of the key you're trying to replicate, <code>ReplicateKey</code> returns an <code>AlreadyExistsException</code> error. If the key state of the existing replica is <code>PendingDeletion</code>, you can cancel the scheduled key deletion (<code>CancelKeyDeletion</code>) or wait for the key to be deleted. The new replica key you create will have the same <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-sync-properties">shared properties</a> as the original replica key.</p>
/// <p>The CloudTrail log of a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation records a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation in the primary key's Region and a <code>CreateKey</code> operation in the replica key's Region.</p>
/// <p>If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html">Importing key material into multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the <code>UpdatePrimaryRegion</code> operation.</p><note>
/// <p><code>ReplicateKey</code> uses different default values for the <code>KeyPolicy</code> and <code>Tags</code> parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p><b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot use this operation to create a replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account.</p>
/// <p><b>Required permissions</b>:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>kms:ReplicateKey</code> on the primary key (in the primary key's Region). Include this permission in the primary key's key policy.</p></li>
