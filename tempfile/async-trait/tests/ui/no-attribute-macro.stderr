error[E0038]: the trait `Trait` is not dyn compatible

12 |     let _: &dyn Trait;
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^ `Trait` is not dyn compatible
   |
note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

   |           ----- this trait is not dyn compatible...
2  |     async fn method(&self);
   |              ^^^^^^ ...because method `method` is `async`
   = help: consider moving `method` to another trait
   = help: only type `Struct` implements `Trait` within this crate; consider using it directly instead.
   = note: `Trait` may be implemented in other crates; if you want to support your users passing their own types here, you can't refer to a specific type
