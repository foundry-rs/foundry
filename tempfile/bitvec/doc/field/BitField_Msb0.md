# `Msb0` Bit-Field Behavior

`BitField` has no requirements about the in-memory representation or layout of
stored integers within a bit-slice, only that round-tripping an integer through
a store and a load of the same element suffix on the same bit-slice is
idempotent (with respect to sign truncation).

`Msb0` provides a contiguous translation from bit-index to real memory: for any
given bit index `n` and its position `P(n)`, `P(n + 1)` is `P(n) - 1`. This
allows it to provide batched behavior: since the section of contiguous indices
used within an element translates to a section of contiguous bits in real
memory, the transaction is always a single shift-mask operation.

Each implemented method contains documentation and examples showing exactly how
the abstract integer space is mapped to real memory.

## Notes

In particular, note that while `Msb0` indexes bits from the most significant
down to the least, and integers index from the least up to the most, this
**does not** re√∂rder any bits of the integer value! This ordering only finds a
region in real memory; it does *not* affect the partial-integer contents stored
in that region.
