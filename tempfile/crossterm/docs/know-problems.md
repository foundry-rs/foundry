# Known Problems

There are some problems I discovered during development. 
And I don't think it has to do anything with crossterm but it has to do with how terminals handle ANSI or WinApi. 

## WinAPI

- Power shell does not interpreter 'DarkYellow' and is instead using gray instead, cmd is working perfectly fine.
- Power shell inserts an '\n' (enter) when the program starts, this enter is the one you pressed when running the command.
- After the program ran, power shell will reset the background and foreground colors.

## UNIX-terminals

The Arc and Manjaro KDE Konsole's are not seeming to resize the terminal instead they are resizing the buffer.
