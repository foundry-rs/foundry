# `dirs-next`

**Note**: This is a fork of once-abandoned `dirs` crate.

There is a mid-level sister library, [directories-next].

## Introduction

- a tiny low-level library with a minimal API
- that provides the platform-specific, user-accessible locations
- for retrieving and storing configuration, cache and other data
- on Linux, Redox, Windows (â‰¥ Vista), macOS and other platforms.

The library provides the location of these directories by leveraging the mechanisms defined by
- the [XDG base directory](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and
  the [XDG user directory](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/) specifications on Linux and Redox
- the [Known Folder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378457.aspx) API on Windows
- the [Standard Directories](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6)
  guidelines on macOS

## Platforms

This library is written in Rust, and supports Linux, Redox, macOS and Windows.
Other platforms are also supported; they use the Linux conventions.

## Minimum Rust version policy

The minimal required version of Rust is `1.34.0`.

We may bump the Rust version in major and minor releases (`x`/`y` in `x.y.z`).
Changing the Rust version will be written in the CHANGELOG.

## Example

Library run by user Alice:

```rust
dirs_next::home_dir();
// Lin: Some(/home/alice)
// Win: Some(C:\Users\Alice)
// Mac: Some(/Users/Alice)

dirs_next::audio_dir();
// Lin: Some(/home/alice/Music)
// Win: Some(C:\Users\Alice\Music)
// Mac: Some(/Users/Alice/Music)

dirs_next::config_dir();
// Lin: Some(/home/alice/.config)
// Win: Some(C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming)
// Mac: Some(/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support)

dirs_next::executable_dir();
// Lin: Some(/home/alice/.local/bin)
// Win: None
// Mac: None
```

## Design Goals

- The _dirs-next_ library is a low-level crate designed to provide the paths to standard directories
  as defined by operating systems rules or conventions. If your requirements are more complex,
  e. g. computing cache, config, etc. paths for specific applications or projects, consider using
  [directories-next] instead.
- This library does not create directories or check for their existence. The library only provides
  information on what the path to a certain directory _should_ be. How this information is used is
  a decision that developers need to make based on the requirements of each individual application.
- This library is intentionally focused on providing information on user-writable directories only.
  There is no discernible benefit in returning a path that points to a user-level, writable
  directory on one operating system, but a system-level, read-only directory on another, that would
  outweigh the confusion and unexpected failures such an approach would cause.
  - `executable_dir` is specified to provide the path to a user-writable directory for binaries.<br/>
    As such a directory only commonly exists on Linux, it returns `None` on macOS and Windows.
  - `font_dir` is specified to provide the path to a user-writable directory for fonts.<br/>
    As such a directory only exists on Linux and macOS, it returns `None` on Windows.
  - `runtime_dir` is specified to provide the path to a directory for non-essential runtime data.
    It is required that this directory is created when the user logs in, is only accessible by the
    user itself, is deleted when the user logs out, and supports all filesystem features of the
    operating system.<br/>
    As such a directory only commonly exists on Linux, it returns `None` on macOS and Windows.

## Features

**If you want to compute the location of cache, config or data directories for your own application or project,
use `ProjectDirs` of the [directories-next] project instead.**
