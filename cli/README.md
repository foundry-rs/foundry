# Foundry CLIs

The CLIs are written using [clap's](https://docs.rs/clap) [derive feature](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/examples/derive_ref/README.md).

Debug logs are printed with
[`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.29/tracing/). You can configure the
verbosity level via the
[`RUST_LOG`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.3.2/tracing_subscriber/fmt/index.html#filtering-events-with-environment-variables)
environment variable, on a per package level,
e.g.:`RUST_LOG=forge=trace,evm_adapters=trace forge test`

## Forge

```

    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    build              build your smart contracts
    clean              removes the build artifacts and cache directories
    completions        generate shell completions script

```

The subcommands are also aliased to their first letter, e.g. you can do
`forge t` instead of `forge test` or `forge b` instead of `forge build`.

### Build

The `build` subcommand proceeds to compile your smart contracts.

```
forge-build
build your smart contracts

USAGE:
    forge build [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -c, --contracts <CONTRACTS>
            the directory relative to the root under which the smart contracts are [env: DAPP_SRC=]
        --evm-version <EVM_VERSION>
            choose the evm version [default: london]
        --force
            force recompilation of the project, deletes the cache and artifacts folders
    -h, --help
            Print help information
        --hardhat
            uses hardhat style project layout. This a convenience flag and is the same as `--contracts contracts --lib-
            paths node_modules`
        --ignored-error-codes <IGNORED_ERROR_CODES>
            ignore warnings with specific error codes
        --lib-paths <LIB_PATHS>
            the paths where your libraries are installed
        --libraries <LIBRARIES>
            add linked libraries
        --no-auto-detect
            if set to true, skips auto-detecting solc and uses what is in the user's $PATH
    -o, --out <OUT_PATH>
            path to where the contract artifacts are stored
        --optimize
            activate the solidity optimizer
        --optimize-runs <OPTIMIZE_RUNS>
            optimizer parameter runs [default: 200]
    -r, --remappings <REMAPPINGS>
            the remappings
        --remappings-env <REMAPPINGS_ENV>
            [env: DAPP_REMAPPINGS=]
        --root <ROOT>
            the project's root path. By default, this is the root directory of the current Git repository or the current
            working directory if it is not part of a Git repository
```

By default, it will auto-detect the solc pragma version requirement per-file and
will use the [latest version](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases)
that satisfies the requirement, (e.g. `pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.8.0` will use
`solc` 0.7.6). If you want to disable this feature, you can call
`forge build --no-auto-detect`, and it'll use whichever `solc` version is in
your `$PATH`.

The project's root directory defaults to the current working directory, assuming
contracts are under `src/` and `lib/`, but can also be configured via the
`--root`, `--lib-paths` and `--contracts` arguments. The contracts and libraries
directories are assumed to be relative to the project root, for example
`forge build --root ../my-project --contracts my-contracts-dir` will try to find
the contracts under `../my-project/my-contracts-dir`. You can also configure the
output directory where the contract artifacts will be written to with the
`--out` variable.

#### Remappings

Compiler remappings are automatically detected, but if you want to override them
you can do it with the `--remappings` flag like below:

```bash
$ forge build --remappings @openzeppelin/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/
```

Alternatively you could provide a `remappings.txt` file in the project root
containing a line separated list of your package names and the path to them. For
example:

```bash
$ cat remappings.txt
ds-test=lib/ds-test/src
@openzeppelin=node_modules/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts
```

This then allows you to import the dependencies in your Solidity code like:

```solidity
import "ds-test/...";
import "@openzeppelin/...";
```

Most of the arguments can also be provided via environment variables, which you
can find by looking for the `env` tooltip in the command's help menu
(`forge build --help`).

### Test

Proceeds to build (if needed) and test your smart contracts. It will look for
any contract with a function name that starts with `test`, deploy it, and run
that test function. If that test function takes any arguments, it will proceed
to "fuzz" it (i.e. call it with a lot of different arguments, default: 256
tries).

The command re-uses all the options of `forge build`, and also allows you to
configure any blockchain context related variables such as the block coinbase,
difficulty etc.

Here's how the CLI output looks like when used with
[`dapptools-template`](https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-template)

```bash
$ forge test
success.
Running 3 tests for "Greet.json":Greet
[PASS] testCanSetGreeting (gas: 31070)
[PASS] testWorksForAllGreetings (gas: [fuzztest])
[PASS] testCannotGm (gas: 6819)

Running 3 tests for "Gm.json":Gm
[PASS] testOwnerCannotGmOnBadBlocks (gas: 7771)
[PASS] testNonOwnerCannotGm (gas: 3782)
[PASS] testOwnerCanGmOnGoodBlocks (gas: 31696)
```

You can optionally specify a regular expression, to only run matching functions:

```bash
$ forge test -m Cannot
$HOME/oss/foundry/target/release/forge test -m Cannot
no files changed, compilation skipped.
Running 1 test for "Greet.json":Greet
[PASS] testCannotGm (gas: 6819)

Running 2 tests for "Gm.json":Gm
[PASS] testNonOwnerCannotGm (gas: 3782)
[PASS] testOwnerCannotGmOnBadBlocks (gas: 7771)
```

In order to compose with other commands, you may print the results as JSON via
the `--json` flag

```bash
$ forge test --json
no files changed, compilation skipped.
{"\"Gm.json\":Gm":{"testNonOwnerCannotGm":{"success":true,"reason":null,"gas_used":3782,"counterexample":null,"logs":[]},"testOwnerCannotGmOnBadBlocks":{"success":true,"reason":null,"gas_used":7771,"counterexample":null,"logs":[]},"testOwnerCanGmOnGoodBlocks":{"success":true,"reason":null,"gas_used":31696,"counterexample":null,"logs":[]}},"\"Greet.json\":Greet":{"testWorksForAllGreetings":{"success":true,"reason":null,"gas_used":null,"counterexample":null,"logs":[]},"testCannotGm":{"success":true,"reason":null,"gas_used":6819,"counterexample":null,"logs":[]},"testCanSetGreeting":{"success":true,"reason":null,"gas_used":31070,"counterexample":null,"logs":[]}}}
```

## Running a Subset of Tests

By default, `forge test` (and `forge snapshot`) will run every function in any contract if the function starts with `test`.

You can narrow down the amount of tests to run by using one or more of the current available command line arguments for matching tests.

```
--match-test <TEST_PATTERN>
--no-match-test <TEST_PATTERN_INVERSE>
--match-contract <CONTRACT_PATTERN>
--no-match-contract <CONTRACT_PATTERN_INVERSE>
```

### Examples

`--match-contract` and `--no-match-contract` matches against the name of the contracts containing tests. Consider the following contracts, each containing a few tests.

```solidity
contract ContractFoo { ... }
contract ContractFooBar { ... }
contract ContractBar { ... }
```

* `forge test --match-contract Contract` will run the tests in all of those contracts
* `forge test --match-contract Foo` will run the tests in the `ContractFoo` and `ContractFooBar`
* `forge test --match-contract "Foo$"` will only run the tests in `ContractFoo`
* `forge test --match-contract "ContractFoo|ContractBar"` will only run the tests of contracts including `ContractFoo` or `ContractBar` in it's name
* `forge test --no-match-contract FooBar` will run the tests in `ContractFoo` and `ContractBar`


`--match-test` and `--no-match-test` matches agains the test function names, by default they start with the `test` prefix. Consider the following contracts with a few test functions.

```solidity
contract ContractFoo {
  func testFoo() {}
  func testFooBar() {}
}

contract ContractBar {
  func testBar() {}
  func testFooBar() {}
}
```

* `forge test --match-test testFoo` will run all tests except for `ContractBar.testBar`
* `forge test --match-test "Foo$"` will run only `ContractFoo.testFoo`
* `forge test --match-test "testFoo$|testBar$"` will run `ContractFoo.testFoo` and `ContractBar.testBar`
* `forge test --no-match-test Bar` will only run `ContractBar.testBar`
* `forge test --no-match-test test` will run no tests

You can always combine any of the four arguments, they have AND semantics.

### Common Patterns

A few common patterns to help with your development workflow.

#### Tracing

When you're trying to find out why a specific test is failing, you can clean up the logs a bit by running only the test you're tracing:

```console
forge test --match-contract MyContractTest --match-test "testBar$" -vvv
# use $ to indicate end of line, otherwise it can match testBarFoo, testBarFooBar etc.
# `--match-contract` is only necessary if you have multiple tests with the same name
```

#### Separating Tests

You might want to run your different kind of tests separately, for example, unit tests vs benchmark, you can suffix the contract name with the type of test to run them separately.

```solidity
contract FooUnitTest {}
contract BarUnitTest {}
contract FooBenchmark {}
contract BarBenchmark {}
```

* To run unit tests `forge test --match-contract "UnitTest$"`
* To get a gas snapshot only of the benchmark tests `forge snapshot --match-contract "Benchmark$"`

### Edge cases

If you have two tests with the same name but different arity (number of arguments), you can't run them individually.

```solidity
function testFoo() public { assert(1 == 1); }
function testFoo(uint256 bar) public { assert(bar == bar); }
```
