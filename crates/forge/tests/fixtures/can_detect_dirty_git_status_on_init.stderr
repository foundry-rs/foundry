Error: 
The target directory is a part of or on its own an already initialized git repository,
and it requires clean working and staging areas, including no untracked files.

Check the current git repository's status with `git status`.
Then, you can track files with `git add ...` and then commit them with `git commit`,
ignore them in the `.gitignore` file, or run this command again with the `--no-commit` flag.

If none of the previous steps worked, please open an issue at:
