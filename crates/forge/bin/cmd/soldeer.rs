// CLI arguments for `forge soldeer`.
// The following list of commands and their actions:
//
// forge soldeer install: looks up the config file and install all the dependencies that are present
// there forge soldeer install package~version: looks up on https://soldeer.xyz and if the package>version is there then add to config+lockfile and install new dependency. Replaces existing entry if version is different.
// forge soldeer install package~version url: same behavior as install but instead of looking at https://soldeer.xyz it choses the URL, which can be git or custom zip url
// forge soldeer update: same behavior as install looks up the config file and install all the
// dependencies that are present there. This will change in the future forge soldeer login: logs in into https://soldeer.xyz account
// forge soldeer push package~version: pushes files to the central repository
// forge soldeer version: checks soldeer version
// forge soldeer init: initializes a new project with minimal dependency for foundry setup, install
// latest forge-std version forge soldeer uninstall dependency: uninstalls a dependency, removes
// artifacts and configs
