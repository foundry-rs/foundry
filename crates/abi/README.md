# foundry-abi

Contains automatically-generated Rust bindings from Solidity ABI.

Additional bindings can be generated by doing the following:

1. add an ABI file in the [`abi` directory](./abi/), using the [ethers-js ABI formats](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/abi/formats);
2. update the [build script](./build.rs)'s `MultiAbigen::new` call;
3. build the crate once with `cargo build -p foundry-abi`, generating the bindings for the first time;
4. export the newly-generated bindings at the root of the crate, in [`lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs).
